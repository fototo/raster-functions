# ArcGIS Raster Functions

This repository houses modern image processing and analytic tools called **raster functions**. 
Raster functions are *lightweight* and process only the pixels visible on your screen, in memory, without creating intermediate files. 
They are *powerful* because you can chain them together and apply them on huge rasters and mosaics on the fly. 

In this repository, you will find useful **function chains** (*.rft.xml) created by the Esri community. 
You can also create custom raster functions in Python that work seamlessly with the several dozen functions that ship with ArcGIS. 


## Getting Started

1. Install [ArcGIS for Desktop 10.3](http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/desktop/) or [ArcGIS Pro 1.0](http://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app). 
   ArcGIS comes with [Python](http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/desktop/latest/analyze/python/what-is-python-.htm).
3. [Download](https://github.com/Esri/raster-functions/archive/master.zip) and unzip this repo.
4. Install Python dependencies:
```
    $ cd scripts
    $ python get-pip.py
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Ready-to-use function templates are in the `templates/` folder. Implementation of raster functions live under `functions/`. 
5. Learn about functions, function chains, and templates by browsing the links under [Resources](#resources).
6. Learn how to create new raster functions using the [Python API](https://github.com/Esri/raster-functions/wiki/PythonRasterFunction#anatomy-of-a-python-raster-function).
